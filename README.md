This was a messaging app developed for the UNSW course COMP1531: Software Engineering Fundamentals.  <br />

We were tasked to develop the backend for the software engineering project management application using  <br />
flask to run the server side of things.  <br />

This project was run like a real world project, as we acted as the software consultants, developing  <br />
code using the agile development methodology. However most of the management was done on a private school <br />
repository, so it won't be possible to go through the commit history. However this is a public version  <br />
of my team's project. <br />

The frontend was provided to us by the course lecturer.  <br />

For more information, check the Project_Spec.md in the project-backend folder  <br />.

## How to Run
To run this app, simply go into the project folder and run this command into the shell  <br />
#### `python3 server.py`
Then open another instance of the shell and run  <br />
#### `python3 frontend.py [BACKEND PORT]`
Pleae enjoy!

## Other Notes
The app still needs a few bugs to be fixed in terms of messaging and add  <br />
missing features. Also, for data persistance it could use an SQL server and <br />
utilise a binary search algorithm to speed up account look up times.
